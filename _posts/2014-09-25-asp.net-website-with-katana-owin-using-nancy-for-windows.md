title: developing and deploying a .NET web application with Katana/Owin and NancyFx for Windows.

For over ten years, ASP.NET developers had no choice but to couple the server and their application together using the [System.Web](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web(v=vs.110).aspx) library.
The choice was so non-existent that any ASP.NET application required [IIS](http://www.iis.net/overview), or an unrecommended alternative like [Apache](http://forums.asp.net/t/1058501.aspx?Do+we+need+IIS+to+run+the+web+application), in order to get in front of end users.
The [System.Web](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web(v=vs.110).aspx) namespace was bulky and extensive with code for Application Services, Compilation, Security, Session State, UI, Web Sockets, and many more.
Unfortunately with all of these components compiled into one libary, a developer could not simply use parts of the namespace pertinent to just their web application.
However, all of that changed with the [Katana](http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) project -- an [OWIN](http://owin.org) implementation for .NET web applications.

# the problem.
Let's say, a development team is tasked to create a web API, using .NET.
One of the requirements is to make the web API lightweight and easy to deploy.
Unfortunately, the team cannot use ASP.NET with the System.Web library because of the large overhead and its tight coupling to a web server (more than likely IIS) with an overwhelming, lengthy deployment process.

# the solution.
By using Katana/OWIN, from the [Microsoft.Owin](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.owin(v=vs.113).aspx) namespace, the web api project will be built with less overhead and will not require a web server.
Without the requirement of the System.Web library, other frameworks can be leveraged for quicker and easier "speed to market."
One of the fastest growing frameworks, which is supported by JetBrains, that is quick and easy is [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/).
The Nancy framework prides themselves on being lightweight, quick to create and deploy, deployable to any OS, and easy to use.
Since both the Nancy framework and Katana/OWIN share the same goals, it makes perfect sense to utilize them when writing a .NET web application.

## source code.
Enough talk, let's get to how to [host a web application with both Nancy and Katana/Owin] (https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Hosting-nancy-with-owin).
First, create a console executable project in visual studio.
Then install [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org), from Nuget with PM Install-Package Nancy.
	
	namespace Demo
	{
		public class RootModule : Nancy.NancyModule
		{
			public RootModule()
			{
				Get["/"] = arguments => "Hello World!";
			}
		}
		
		public class Startup
		{
			/// <summary>
			/// Configures the web app to use nancy as its app builder.
			/// </summary>
			/// <param name="app">The web application</param>
			public void Configuration(Owin.IAppBuilder app)
			{
				app.UseNancy();
			}
		}
		
		using System;	
		class Program
		{
			static void Main(string[] args)
			{
				using (Microsoft.Owin.Hosting.WebApp.Start<Startup>("http://+:4444"))
				{
					Console.ReadKey();                
				}
			}
		}
	}


## deployment.
Since this project is a web service and a console executable, using the Task Scheduler to deploy executables is one option.
I chose implement it as a Task because it is easier to configure and maintain.

### networking.
Configure the Windows Firewall to allow communication over the port specified in the Program class.
If the firewall already allows communication over the port specified, skip to the configuration section.

1. Open the Control Panel, and Click on Windows Firewall
2. Click the Advanced Settings link, will open Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.
3. Click on Inbound Rules and in the right pane, click New Rule
4. From the New Inbound Rule Wizard, Select the rule to be for Port.
5. The rule should by default apply to TCP and enter the desired port number in the Specific local ports field.
6. Ensure the Allow the connection button is selected.
7. Select the desired profile: Domain, Private, and/or Public.
8. Enter a name in the Name field.

### configuration.
1. Create a directory to hold the web application source code, perhaps at C:\Demo.
	* Copy the web application's release output into the directory (the executable and its references).
2. Open the Task Scheduler and create a task for the web application.
	* Create a trigger to start the application at system startup.
	* Create an action to start a program, point this to the executable of the web application.
	* Create a condition, specifically for the network portion to start if any network connection is available.

With the port open for communication and the configuration complete, the web application will be started at system startup.
Simply reboot the system or in Task Scheduler right click on the DEMO task and run it.

In the next post, I will show how developers can use Katana/OWIN with Nancy to deploy an API on linux distributions.
As for this post, I hope it helps you determine when and how to use Katana/OWIN.
