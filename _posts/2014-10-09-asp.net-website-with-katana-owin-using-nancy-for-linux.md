title: deploying a .NET web application with Katana/Owin, NancyFx, and Mono for linux distributions.
comments: true
---

As we learned in the previous post, .NET developers have been strickened to the bulkiness of the System.Web library.
However, with the latest development with the [Katana](http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) project -- an [OWIN](http://owin.org) implementation for .NET web applications, web developers are not required utilize large web servers such as IIS or Apache Tomcat for web hosting.
Moreover, .NET web applications, with Katana/OWIN, have the capabilities to run on other operating systems with the use of Mono.

# the problem.

# the solution.

## source code.
Majority of this demo code came from the previous post and a [Nancy reference article](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Hosting-Nancy-with-Nginx-on-Ubuntu).
Not much has changed except for the Program class.
Instead of just Console.ReadKey(), which pretty much allows the web application to run until the user gains focus to the application and types any key.
The Program class accounts for Mono not elegantly supporting Console.Readline, by infinitely sleeping when -r is passed upon its execution.

	namespace Demo
	{
		public class RootModule : Nancy.NancyModule
		{
			public RootModule()
			{
				Get["/"] = arguments => "Hello World!";
			}
		}
		
		public class Startup
		{
			/// <summary>
			/// Configures the web app to use nancy as its app builder.
			/// </summary>
			/// <param name="app">The web application</param>
			public void Configuration(Owin.IAppBuilder app)
			{
				app.UseNancy();
			}
		}
		
		using System;	
		class Program
		{
			static void Main(string[] args)
			{
				using (Microsoft.Owin.Hosting.WebApp.Start<Startup>("http://+:4444"))
				{
					// Under mono, you cannot process Console.ReadLine will cause EOF
					// so keep the process running until the end of time.
					// use command line argument -r for release.
					if (args.Any(s => s.Equals("-r", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)))
					{
						Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
					}
					else 
					{
						Console.ReadKey();
					}                
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
## debian linux deployment.
Pick your debian distribution.
Personally, my favorites are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Kali Linux (formally known as BackTrack Linux).
For these purposes, I went with Ubuntu because of my familiarity with it and the large support customer base (just in case I run into trouble).

### updates and installations.
Resync the package index files from their sources with "apt-get update."
Install the newest version of all the packages currently installed with "apt-get upgrade."
Install mono with "apt-get install mono-complete" and install supervisor with "apt-get install supervisor."
Please keep in mind, at the time of this demo, I was utilizing Mono version 3.2.8.
If you experience any issues at a version higher or lower, please comment below for the next reader.

### configurations.
In order to use supervisor for the web application, a configuration file must be created and configured.
Create a new configuration file, specifically a .conf file, at /etc/supervisor/conf.d.
The name of the configuration file is arbitary but in eccense of maintability, let's name it demo.conf.
Configure the demo.conf file similar to this:
	[program:demo]
	command=mono demo.exe -r
	user=www-data
	stderr_logfile = /var/log/supervisor/demo-err.log
	stdout_logfile = /var/log/supervisor/demo-stdout.log
	directory=/var/www/demo.dm

The directory field can be directed anywhere.
All that matters is the directory contains the release built output of the web application executable.
So, with the configuration complete, be sure to copy bin contents to the directory specified in the demo.conf file.

### start.
With the console executable web service configured with supervisor, the web application will be started at system startup.
Simply reboot the system or open supervisor control manager with supervisorctl, update supervisor (with the update command), and start the web application with start demo.

## redhat linux deployment.
Depending on what red hat derivative is selected, be prepared to [build an RPM](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-build.html) for an updated Mono release.
In my experiences, with another colleague, CentOS is one linux distro that will require an RPM for Mono.
If experience difficulties with building an RPM, please comment below and appropriate instruction can be provided.

### updates and installations.
Resync the package index files from their sources with yum-update.
Install mono with yum install mono-core.
Install supervisor with [easy_install](http://supervisord.org/installing.html#installing-to-a-system-with-internet-access).
Specifically, if you do not have the setup tools, install them with yum install python-setuptools and then run easy_install supervisor to install supervisor

### configurations.
The configuration file, directory structure, and directory contents is the same a debian distribution.
Please follow the configuration instructions above for the debian distribution.

### start.
Starting the console executable web service is the same as a debian distribution.
The web application will be started at system startup or can be started from the supervisor control manager.

Hopefully, this post will demonstrate the strength of the server and web application being decoupled in .NET.
The strength being, with it decoupled, the web application has the liberty of being deployed onto any web server on any operating system.
