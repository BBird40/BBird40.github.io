title: deploying a .NET web application with Katana/Owin, NancyFx, and Mono for linux distributions.
comments: true
---

As we learned in the previous post, .NET developers have been strickened to the bulkiness of the System.Web library.
However, with the latest development of the [Katana](http://katanaproject.codeplex.com/) project -- an [OWIN](http://owin.org) implementation for .NET web applications, web developers are not required to utilize large web servers such as IIS or Apache Tomcat for web hosting.
Along with the web server decoupling, .NET web applications built with Katana/OWIN have easy, fluid capabilities to run on other operating systems with the use of [Mono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mono_(software)).

-----

# the problem.
Much like the previous post, a development team is tasked to create a web API, using the .NET framework.
The requirements are to make the web API lightweight and easy to deploy.
The most important requirement is to make the web API deployable to operating systems other than Windows.

# the solution.
Again, referring back to the previous post, with the utilization of Katana/OWIN paired with the [Nancy](http://nancyfx.org/) framework the web application will be lightweight, easy to create & use, and deployable to any operating system.
The true power stemming from the separation of the web server and the web application.
Moreover, with that separation, the amount of risks are reduced because the application is not required to be hosted on a web server such as Tomcat, [nginx](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Hosting-Nancy-with-Nginx-on-Ubuntu), or any other [FastCgi](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Hosting-Nancy-with-FastCgi) webserver.
For this solution, let's start by creating an executable demo web application that references Katana/OWIN and Nancy, that will ultimately be deployable to linux with the use of Mono.

## source code.
Majority of this demo code came from the previous post and a [Nancy reference article](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy/wiki/Hosting-Nancy-with-Nginx-on-Ubuntu).
Not much has changed except for the Program class.
Instead of just Console.ReadKey(), the Program class accounts for Mono not elegantly supporting Console.Readline, by infinitely sleeping when -r is passed upon its execution.

	namespace Demo
	{
		public class RootModule : Nancy.NancyModule
		{
			public RootModule()
			{
				Get["/"] = arguments => "Hello World!";
			}
		}
		
		public class Startup
		{
			/// <summary>
			/// Configures the web app to use nancy as its app builder.
			/// </summary>
			/// <param name="app">The web application</param>
			public void Configuration(Owin.IAppBuilder app)
			{
				app.UseNancy();
			}
		}
		
		using System;	
		class Program
		{
			static void Main(string[] args)
			{
				using (Microsoft.Owin.Hosting.WebApp.Start<Startup>("http://+:4444"))
				{
					// Under mono, you cannot process Console.ReadLine will cause EOF
					// so keep the process running until the end of time.
					// use command line argument -r for release.
					if (args.Any(s => s.Equals("-r", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase)))
					{
						Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
					}
					else 
					{
						Console.ReadKey();
					}                
				}
			}
		}
	}
	
## debian linux deployment.
Pick your debian distribution.
Personally, my favorites are Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Kali Linux (formally known as BackTrack Linux).
For these purposes, I went with Ubuntu because of my familiarity with it and the large support in the user base (just in case I run into trouble).

### updates and installations.
Resync the package index files from their sources with "apt-get update."
Install the newest version of all the packages currently installed with "apt-get upgrade."
Install mono with "apt-get install mono-complete" and install supervisor with "apt-get install supervisor."
Please keep in mind, at the time of this demo, I was utilizing Mono version 3.2.8.
If you experience any issues at a version higher or lower, please comment below for the next reader.

### configurations.
In order to use supervisor for the web application, a configuration file must be created and configured.
Create a new configuration file, specifically a .conf file, at /etc/supervisor/conf.d.
The name of the configuration file is arbitary but in the eccense of maintainability, let's name it demo.conf.
Configure the demo.conf file similar to this:
	
	[program:demo]
	command=mono demo.exe -r
	user=www-data
	stderr_logfile = /var/log/supervisor/demo-err.log
	stdout_logfile = /var/log/supervisor/demo-stdout.log
	directory=/var/www/demo

The directory field can be directed anywhere.
All that matters is the directory contains the release built output of the web application executable.
So, with the configuration complete, be sure to copy bin contents to the directory specified in the demo.conf file.

### start.
With the executable web service configured with supervisor, the web application will be started at system startup.
Simply reboot the system or open supervisor control manager with supervisorctl, update supervisor (with the update command), and start the web application with start demo.

## redhat linux deployment.
Depending on what red hat derivative is selected, be prepared to [build an RPM](http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm/ch-rpm-build.html) for an updated Mono release.
In my experiences, with another colleague, CentOS is one linux distro that will require an RPM for Mono.
If you experience difficulties with building an RPM, please comment below and appropriate instruction can be provided.

### updates and installations.
Much like the debian instructions, resync the package index files from their sources with "yum-update".
Install mono with "yum install mono-core".
Install supervisor with [easy_install](http://supervisord.org/installing.html#installing-to-a-system-with-internet-access).
Specifically, if you do not have the setup tools, install them with "yum install python-setuptools" and then run "easy_install supervisor" to install supervisor.

### configurations.
The configuration file, directory structure, and directory contents are the same as the debian distribution.
For the supervisor configuration, please follow the instructions above.

### start.
Starting the executable web service is the same as a debian distribution.
The web application will be started at system startup or can be started from the supervisor control manager.

# reference links.
Attached are some of the links from my previous post with some links relevant to this post.
If the blog leaves out any detail, I am confident the plethora of Nancy documentation will lead you in a positive direction.
In the event the links do not help, visit the [chatroom](http://jabbr.net) designated for Nancy or comment below.
I'm sure as a community a solution can be found.

Hopefully, this post will demonstrate the strength of the server and web application being separated in .NET.
The strength being, with it decoupled, the web application has the liberty of being deployed onto any operating system with or without a web server.
